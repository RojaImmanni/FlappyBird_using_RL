# Flappy-Bird-using-RL
Training an agent to play Flappy Bird using Q learning

## Names:
Roja Immanni

## Finalized Research Question:
Is it possible to train an RL agent to play FlappyBird game forever?

## Code files
Code for environment can be found at https://github.com/RojaImmanni/Flappy-Bird-using-RL/blob/master/environment.py

Code for random agent can be found at https://github.com/RojaImmanni/Flappy-Bird-using-RL/blob/master/RandomAgent.py

Code for a trainable agent can be found at https://github.com/RojaImmanni/Flappy-Bird-using-RL/blob/master/TrainableAgent.py

## List of ideas to finish project:

- The state of the project is a pixel image of 3 channels. Process this image data input to convert its representation to get x, y position and speed. 
- We implement Q-learning with Îµ-greedy approach
